SMTP Client
^^^^^^^^^^^
'clsmtp <hostname> <port>' will initiate an SSL encrypted TCP connection to the
SMTP server at <hostname>:<port>.  It will proceed to read newline separated
SMTP client commands (as defined by [RFC 5321]) from standard input and
send them to the server without checking for correctness. After sending each
command, clsmtp will wait for a numeric, three-digit SMTP reply code. If the
reply code is of the form 2yz (positive completion) then we continue to the
next command in stdandard input. If the reply code is of the form 3yz (positive
intermediate) then subsequent lines of standard input are sent immediatly
until the special line containing only a dot '.' is encountered. If the reply
code is not either of the two above forms, then the program exits in failure.

IMAP Client
^^^^^^^^^^^

'climap <hostname> <port> <script>' will initiate an SSL encrypted TCP
connection to the IMAP server at <hostname>:<port>. It then  forks+exec's
into <script>, setting the DIR environment variable to the path of a new
tempoary directory.
    TODO: giving file descriptor to child process.
The ??file descriptor?? of this child process shall be read by
climap as a series of newline separated IMAP client commands (as defined by
[RFC 9051]). These commands will be prefixed with a unique tag and sent to
the server synchronously. Before sending the next command in the sequence,
climap will wait for the tagged server completion response corresponding to
the latter.
    TODO: handling of status response.
When climap receives untagged server responses, it populates the directory
structure DIR with files containing the read data. The <script> process may
read this directory structure and the files enclosed to produce output and
choose what commands to send next.
